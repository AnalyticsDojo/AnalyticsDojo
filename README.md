Welcome to the AnalyticsDojo open source codebase and curriculum!


AnalyticsDojo is a data science community where you learn to data science and work on real projects.


You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based data science curriculum.

**We are still in the process of building out the curriculum.  It is an exciting time.**

Support
------------


This project was inspired by and forked from the awesome folks over at [Free Code Camp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp), but we aren't associated with that organization. Right now it is supported by [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu), but we are hoping to build a team of supporters from around the world.
