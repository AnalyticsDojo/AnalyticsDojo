                <h4>What is Analytics Dojo?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">We’re an open source community that helps you learn to code.</p>
                <h4>How do you help me learn to code?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">You can work through our self-paced coding challenges, build projects, and earn certifications. We also connect you with people in your city so you can code together.</p>
                <h4>Can Analytics Dojo help me get a job as a software engineer?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">Yes. Hundreds of people have gotten software engineering jobs after completing our coding challenges.</p>
                <h4>Is Analytics Dojo a coding bootcamp?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">No. A lot of coding bootcamps use Analytics Dojo as part of their curriculum, though.</p>
                <h4>Is Analytics Dojo really free?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">Yes. Our curriculum, nonprofit projects, and verified certifications are all free.</p>
                <h4>Which certifications does Analytics Dojo offer?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">We offer four free verified certifications: front end development, back end development, data visualization, and full stack development.</p>
                <h4>How can I help nonprofits through Analytics Dojo?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">Once you finish the first three certifications, you’ll get to build a series of solutions for nonprofits. You’ll work in pairs, under the supervision of a volunteer project manager and a stakeholder from the nonprofit.</p>
                <h4>How much money has Analytics Dojo saved nonprofits?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">Our community has done nearly a million dollars worth of pro-bono coding for nonprofits so far.</p>
                <h4>Is there a way I can help nonprofits before I earn my certifications?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">Yes. You can <a href="/commit">pledge a monthly donation to a nonprofit of your choosing</a> while you learn.</p>
                <h4>How long does Analytics Dojo take?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">It takes about 2,080 hours to earn all four of our certifications. This translates into one year of full-time coding. We’re completely self-paced though, so take as long as you need.</p>
                <h4>Is Analytics Dojo a replacement for a 4-year degree?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">No. Please don’t drop out of college just to pursue Analytics Dojo. You can pursue both concurrently. Even though you don’t need a 4-year degree to work as a software engineer, it still helps a lot.</p>
                <h4>I'm a teacher. Is Analytics Dojo an appropriate resource for my class?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">Yes. Many high school, college, and adult ed programs incorporate Analytics Dojo into their coursework. We're open source, so no licenses or special permission from us is necessary. We're even building special tools for teachers.</p>
                <h4>Should I complete all of these challenges in order?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">We’ve put a lot of thought into how we introduce concepts. But you’re free to jump around.</p>
                <h4>Do I have to use CodePen for the front end projects?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">As long as your code is publicly viewable, and you have a live demo, you can use whatever you want.</p>
                <h4>When will you release the additional React, Sass, and D3 challenges?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15">We’ll release these in Spring 2016. In the meantime, other people have completed our React/Sass and D3 projects by referencing their official documentation.</p>
                <h4>How did Analytics Dojo get started?</h4>
                <p class="negative-15"><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Quincy-Larson" target="_blank">Quincy Larson</a> started our open source community in 2014. He is now just one of many active contributors.</p>
