            | Analytics Dojo is friendly place to learn to data science. We’re committed to keeping it that way.
        p
            | All students are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We’ll enforce this code. We’re expecting cooperation from all leaners in ensuring a friendly environment for everybody.
        p In short: be nice to your fellow students.
        p Remember these 3 things and your fellow students will like you:
        ol
            li Compliment your fellow students when they do good work. Congratulate them when they accomplish something (like completing one of our certifications or getting a job).
            li Critique the work, not the student doing it.
            li Only argue about something if it’s important to the greater discussion.
        p
            | Analytics Dojo should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof).
        p
            | We do not tolerate harassment of students in any form, anywhere on Analytics Dojo’s online media (Gitter, Twitch, Facebook, etc.) or during pair programming. Harassment includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwelcome sexual attention, libel, and any malicious hacking or social engineering.
        p
            | If a student engages in harassing behavior, our team will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning them from Analytics Dojo.
        p
            | No bots are allowed in any of the Official Chat Rooms without prior explicit permission from the FCC Core Team.
        p
            | We want everyone to feel safe and respected. If you are being harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, say something! Go to our &thinsp;
            a(href='https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/admin' target='_blank') Admin room in Gitter
            | &thinsp; and explain what has happened where (preferably with a screen shot of the offending language) so we can take fast action.
        p
            | If you have questions about this code of conduct, email us at&thinsp;
