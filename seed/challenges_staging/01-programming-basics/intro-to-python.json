They are also open source and free to get started.  The AnalyticsDojo will provide you with a strong foundation in both R and Python, and the tools that we will adopt frequently support both languages.<br><br> SPARK has seen tremendous growth because it provides an accessible language in which one can access the BIG DATA (i.e., Hadoop) ecosystem-which is also increasingly possible from Python and even R. Tableau is a beautifully designed tool that makes a great first introduction to visualization.  Scikit-learn may seem like a new language, but don't worry...it is just a machine learning library for Python.",

While the 'how' can a challenge the when and why will take more time and we hope that by viewing a wide range of technologies and case studies these will become second nature. To frame the processes of addressing a data science problem, we will be using the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP) model to provide a guide. This breaks down analytics into manageable steps. For each, we may utilize different tools and technologies. But before we can get started with data science, let's start with some of the technologies we will be using for data science.",
